        <h3>Introduction/ Bio</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;I have over 10 years of working experience in Hong Kong. Most of them are in the field of food and beverage. During the Covid-19 pendemic, I have been isolated at home and come across a webside called <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project</a>. I have always interested in computer science, so I start to follow the guidelines there and learn html and css. I found that I am really into the IT field. Moreover, I felt that I do not want to be in the food and beverage industry for the rest of my life. That is why I came to Canada and study computer science.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;My grades when I am studying computer science are mostly A, all thanks to the instructors here and the practice questions on <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode</a>. I have also attended some career talks hosted in Langara College. And the cybersecurity meeting caught my attention. I started to do reasech on how to become an cybersecurity analyist. I came across a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidbombal">davidbombal</a> and start to learn some hacking skills and work on <a href="https://www.kali.org">Kali</a> Linux Operation System. And now, in the year of 2024, I have decided to go into cybersecurity field and planning on self study for a <a href="https://www.isc2.org/landing/exam-peace-of-mind?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GBL-exam-peace-of-mind-protection-promo&utm_term=search&utm_content=GBL-exam-peace-of-mind-protection-promo&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8LuklI3yhAMVKi2tBh351gKxEAAYAiAAEgIfa_D_BwE">CISSP</a>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Beside cybersecurity, I am also into <a href="#">photography</a>, video editing, and cooking (more like a habit from working in food and beverage industry). I have also created a React website called <a href="https://thriving-kleicha-aff060.netlify.app/">Vancomer</a> attempting to help people visiting Vancouver from my full stack course in Langara. This is a project that I am proud of, thanks to my teammates, Luisa and Xavier. We may decide to actually launch it when we graduated and complete a few features that can contribute to our community.</p>
