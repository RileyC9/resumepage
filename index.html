        <h3>Introduction/ Bio</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;I have over 10 years of working experience in Hong Kong. Most of them are in the field of food and beverage. During the Covid-19 pendemic, I have been isolated at home and come across a webside called <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project</a>. I have always interested in computer science, so I start to follow the guidelines there and learn html and css. I found that I am really into the IT field. Moreover, I felt that I do not want to be in the food and beverage industry for the rest of my life. That is why I came to Canada and study computer science.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;My grades when I am studying computer science are mostly A, all thanks to the instructors here and the practice questions on <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode</a>. I have also attended some career talks hosted in Langara College. And the cybersecurity meeting caught my attention. I started to do reasech on how to become an cybersecurity analyist. I came across a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidbombal">davidbombal</a> and start to learn some hacking skills and work on <a href="https://www.kali.org">Kali</a> Linux Operation System. And now, in the year of 2024, I have decided to go into cybersecurity field and planning on self study for a <a href="https://www.isc2.org/landing/exam-peace-of-mind?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GBL-exam-peace-of-mind-protection-promo&utm_term=search&utm_content=GBL-exam-peace-of-mind-protection-promo&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8LuklI3yhAMVKi2tBh351gKxEAAYAiAAEgIfa_D_BwE">CISSP</a>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Beside cybersecurity, I am also into <a href="#">photography</a>, video editing, and cooking (more like a habit from working in food and beverage industry). I have also created a React website called <a href="https://thriving-kleicha-aff060.netlify.app/">Vancomer</a> attempting to help people visiting Vancouver from my full stack course in Langara. This is a project that I am proud of, thanks to my teammates, Luisa and Xavier. We may decide to actually launch it when we graduated and complete a few features that can contribute to our community.</p>

            <li><a href="#">Vancomer</a>
              <p>This is a full stack website which intend to help people that is new to Vancouver. Our team came up with this idea because we all faced different difficulties as an international student. There are 2 types of users in this website: the client role and the job seeker role. Clients, who are new to Vancouver, can post requests on our platform and get help with differnt issues like housing, transportation, education, etc. Clients specify the time for this job/request. These jobs/requests are store in our database. A job seeker can signup and specify the predefined areas that they are able to provide help. When they login, their dashboard page will fetch jobs/requests from our database, according to the areas that the job seekers declared when they signup. They can apply for the job/request and provide the amount of money needed for this job. The client can see all the applicants on the job they posted and choose their provider.</p>
              <p>There are a few issues in this project right now. First, the database will sleep while not using. It also takes sometime to wake up. This is because we have not paid for the database to be up 24/7. Second, we planned to update the website with signin with social media features in the future. Lastly, we will also look into the payment system if we decided to actually run this in the real world. Since maintance have a cost, we may collect 50 cents, a dollar, or a small percentage of the job charged by the job seeker on each transaction.</p>
              <p>Additionally, if we are actually launching this website, we will also add other security related features like 2 step authentication and more secure data encryption.</p>

            <li><a href="#">EasyGrammar</a>
              <p>This is a front-end website that uses the FreeDictionary API and OpenAI API to assist our user to improve their English.
              User starts to use the website by entering a word. The website will use the user's input and fetch data from
              FreeDictionary API. If the fetch is successful, it will display the word's definition and an pronounciation button which
              plays an audio of how the word is pronounced. Otherwise, it will display the word the user entered is not found. After
              the definition is displayed, it will also fetch an image generated by the OpenAI API that is related to the searched
              word. The user then need to describe the image as detail as possible. The website will send the user's description with
              a evaluation process to OpenAI API for an grammar analysis and a grade for the user. In this way, the user can practice English writing and learn new vocabularies to improve their English.</p>
